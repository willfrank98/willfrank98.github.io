      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p id="about-me">Originally born and raised in a suburb of Philadelphia, I now live in Salt Lake City, Utah, and study computer
        science at the University of Utah. I have always loved being around computers, and by the time I was entering high
        school I was fairly certain I wanted to be a computer programmer. I was able to take advantage of the programming classes
        my high school offered and my love grew, even building my own computer in 10th grade. Now in my third year of college,
        I am looking for an internship to gain further experience in the field of software engineering. I love learning new
        things and working on complex problems, and am eager to build my skills in the real world.</p>

        levels, and
        up to one friend request, as well as a few other parameters.</p>
      <p>Java was chosen for its cross-platform capabilities, as the intended users need to be able to run on any
        environment
        without knowing how to compile code.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <a href="https://github.com/willfrank98/Logic-Quest" target="_blank">Github</a>
      <p>Logic Quest is an educational game designed to teach the user about the function of logic gates (AND, XOR,
        etc.). The game was created in a group of 7 as our final project for CS 3505, Software Practices II.</p>
      <p>Being an immensely collaborative process everyone contributed to nearly every facet of the game, however I was
        primarily responsible for designing and implementing the UI within each level, as well as level switching and
        the level loading mechanism.</p>
      <p>The game uses an intuitive drag and drop interface within each level, with an automatically updating display
        of the output for the given inputs. Additionally, our game was written in a way that each level was encoded in
        plaintext in such a way that anyone could modify the levels to whatever they desire.</p>
      <p>This project was invaluable for teaching me about working in a larger group, as well as planning for and organizing
        what occasionally felt like too many people.</p>

      <p>QtSE is a sprite editor written in C++/Qt. It's many features included multiple frames, live animation
        preview, GIF exporting, sprite sheet exporting, PNG exporting, textfile-based saving and loading, feathering brush,
        mirror paint brush, bucket fill, color replace, ellipse tool, square tool, line tool, and selection moving.</p>
      <p>QtSE was created in a group of 6 students. I was primarily responsible for implementing textfile-based saving
        and loading, as well as vertically mirrored painting, and the color replace brush.</p>

      <a href="https://github.com/willfrank98/Machine_Learning_Project" target="_blank">Github</a>
      <p>A class project for which the only requirement was that a major component involve machine learning. I decided to
        attempt to predict stock market movements using primarily news articles. The project is coded in Python using the
        Anaconda distribution. The final pipeline involves converting New York Times headlines for one day into term
        frequency-inverse document frequency representation and labeling them with the Dow Jones Industrial Average's
        performance over the next 10 days. Overall results were somewhat disappointing, though not discouraging. A full
        explanation of what was tried can be found on the github repo under Final Report. My implementation, as well as
        instructions for replication my results can be found on the github page as well.</p>
